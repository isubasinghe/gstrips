# gstrips
Project is basically empty, project created for accountability reasons. 
This is something I wanted to write for quite a while but never got to, I am hoping that creating this project will shame me into completing it.

This is a fairly simple project, I just want to implement Width Based planning on my own little STRIPS PDDL like language.

Further Improvements:
* It would be interesting to have hygenic macros, largely because writing STRIPS can be error prone and verbose.
